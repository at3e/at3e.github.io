Temporal demodulation is a widely employed technique for signal characterization. Here, I propose an envelope extraction method for periodic signals in presence of ambient noise when the signal and noise characteristics overlap. The design of a filter without prior knowledge of the noise characteristics can prove to be a challenging task. Given a clean template signal, cross coherence can be used to score the signal purity against time.
Let `$r(t)$` be a signal.

No laudem altera adolescens has, volumus lucilius eum no. Eam ei nulla audiam efficiantur. Suas affert per no, ei tale nibh sea. Sea ne magna harum, in denique scriptorem sea, cetero alienum tibique ei eos. Labores persequeris referrentur eos ei.
