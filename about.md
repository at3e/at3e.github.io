**Motivation**

I have always been intrigued by the notion of randomness. My earliest opinion regarding the concept formed while studying physics in school where it seemed that nature's complex dynamics were dismissed as randomness for all practical purposes. Interestingly, when one discounts the minute details and observes nature on a macroscopic level, the underlying patterns become readily discernable.  In college, I studied electrical signals and systems expanding my understanding of how the state of a system could be deciphered by analysing the outcomes resulting from specific input perturbations. During my senior year of undergrad, I learnt about stochastic processes and how randomness can be harnessed to comprehend the world around us. It all seemed very exciting. 


**Biodata**

I hold a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering (EE), with a specialization in Signal Processing and Communication Systems, and a keen interest in solving inverse problems in signal processing. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked in the domains of speech and image processing, and my projects have involved a combination of signal processing theory and applied machine learning. I currently work in the EDA industry, where I am primarily responsible for providing solutions for post‑implementation optimizations on FPGA devices. A significant part of my work involves algorithmic design for graphs. Please refer to my publications page for further information.

Apart from research, I enjoy reading crime fiction and playing the violin.
