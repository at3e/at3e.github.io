**Motivation**

I have always been intrigued by the notion of randomness. My earliest opinion regarding the concept formed while studying physics in school where it seemed that nature's complex dynamics were dismissed as randomness for all practical purposes. Interestingly, when one discounts the minute details and observes nature on a macroscopic level, the underlying patterns become readily discernable.  In college, I studied electrical signals and systems expanding my understanding of how the state of a system could be deciphered by analysing the outcomes resulting from specific input perturbations. During my senior year of undergrad, I learnt about stochastic processes and how randomness can be harnessed to comprehend the world around us. It all seemed very exciting. 


**Biodata**

I hold a bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University and a Master's degree from The Indian Institute of Technology Madras(IITM) in Electrical Engineering(EE), with a specialisation in Signal Processing and Communication Systems and a keen interest in solving inverse problems in signal processing. I have worked in speech and image processing domains, and my projects so far involve a combination of signal processing theory and applied ML. During my MS program, I was trained in research practices such as planning an experiment and writing at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/). I work in the EDA industry and understand and develop ML algorithms for graph analysis.

Apart from research, I enjoy reading crime fiction and playing the violin.
