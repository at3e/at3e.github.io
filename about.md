I have always been intrigued by the concept of randomness. My earliest opinion regarding the concept developed while studying physics in school was that nature's complex dynamics were dismissed as randomness for all practical purposes. It was interesting to note that when one discounts the minute details, then on a macroscopic level, one can observe that most natural processes have an underlying pattern, and most systems can be deciphered by the mere perception of the outcome given specific input signals. In college, I studied electrical signals and systems. During my senior year of undergrad, I learnt about stochastic processes and how randomness can be harnessed to comprehend the world around us. It all seemed so exciting!

I hold a bachelor's degree from Jadavpur University and a Master's degree from The Indian Institute of Technology Madras(IITM) in India in Electrical Engineering(EE), with a specialisation in Signal Processing and Communication Systems and a keen interest in solving inverse problems in signal processing. I have worked in speech and image processing domains, and my projects so far involve a combination of signal processing theory and applied ML. During my MS program, I was trained in research practices such as planning an experiment and writing at the [Computational Imaging Lab](https://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/comp_photolab/). Currently, I work in the EDA industry and understand and develop ML algorithms for graph analysis.

Apart from research, I enjoy reading crime fiction and playing the violin.
