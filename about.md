I have always been intrigued by the concept of randomness. My earliest opinion regarding the concept was that of the complex dynamics of nature dismissed as randomness for all practical purposes. When one discounts the very minute details, then on a macroscopic level, one is able to observe that most natural processes have an underlying pattern, and deciphering the design by the mere perception of the process outcome has intrigued human intellect in various forms. In my case, it has been the study of electrical signals. Later, I learned that randomness was an important tool for understanding systems. 
I am currently finishing the Master of Science (MS) program in Electrical Engineering(EE) at The Indian Institute of Technology Madras(IITM) in India with a specialisation in Signal Processing and Communication Systems and a keen interest in solving inverse problems in signal processing. 
During my Bachelor’s and Master’s programs, I acquired broad knowledge about digital signal processing in speech, image processing, and machine learning(ML). During my undergraduate studies, I opted for Instrumentation as an elective subject and engaged in projects where I studied denoising and feature extraction algorithms and applied ML. The swift progress of my Bachelor’s degree under the guidance of senior researchers allowed me to push a couple of publications to conferences. Later, I joined IITM as an MS student in my second year. It has been a crucial phase as, during this period, I took courses on Probability and Statistics, Optimization, and Machine Learning. I also started learning about research practices such as planning an experiment, thinking independently, and writing. Towards completing my Master’s program, I have held responsible for a high-resolution phase imaging project using the Fourier Ptychography at the Computational Imaging Lab. In general terms, my project involves the study of phase retrieval algorithms and developing a Residual neural network model that also imposes the physics of the imaging system for the purpose. I have also started working with a healthcare startup company for Signal processing and ML. My project is based on phonocardiogram analysis. 
Apart from research, I enjoy sharing knowledge. Therefore, during my Master’s, I embraced my teaching assistantship duties in undergraduate-level courses. My 
responsibilities included preparing reading materials, conducting doubt-clearing sessions, and correcting examination answers. These activities have taught me to work in a team and improve my presentation skills.
