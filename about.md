**Motivation**

I have always been intrigued by the notion of randomness. My earliest impressions of the concept formed while studying physics in school, where it often seemed that nature's complex dynamics were dismissed as randomness for all practical purposes. Interestingly, when one discounts the minute details and observes nature on a macroscopic level, the underlying patterns become readily discernible. In college, I studied electrical signals and systems, which expanded my understanding of how the state of a system could be deciphered by analyzing the outcomes resulting from specific input perturbations. During my senior year of undergraduate study, I learned about stochastic processes and how randomness can be harnessed to comprehend the world around us. It was all very exciting, and it sparked a lasting curiosity in me to explore how seemingly chaotic phenomena can reveal order, structure, and meaning when approached with the right mathematical and analytical tools.

**Biodata**

I hold a Bachelor's degree and a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering (EE), with a specialization in Signal Processing and Communication Systems, and a keen interest in solving inverse problems in signal processing. Throughout my academic journey, I have worked in the domains of speech and image processing, and my projects have involved a combination of signal processing theory and applied machine learning. I currently work in the EDA industry, where I am primarily responsible for providing solutions for post‑implementation optimizations on FPGA devices. A significant part of my work involves algorithmic design for graphs. Please refer to my publications page for further information.

Apart from research, I enjoy reading crime fiction and playing the violin.
